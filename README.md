[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/giraffesyo/downmark.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/giraffesyo/downmark)
[![CI](https://github.com/giraffesyo/downmark/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=canary)](https://github.com/giraffesyo/downmark/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Convert documents to Markdown. Pure Go — no Python, no cgo, no external
tools. One static binary; also usable as a library where **you only link
the formats you import**.

downmark is a native Go re-imagining of Microsoft's
[markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown): the same job (get
documents into clean, LLM-friendly Markdown) without the Python runtime and
native dependencies.

## Supported formats

| Format | Package | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PDF | `convert/pdf` | Text extraction via [github.com/giraffesyo/pdf](https://github.com/giraffesyo/pdf): Form XObjects (Google Docs exports), Identity-H composite fonts, ToUnicode CMaps, segmented content streams, inline images; hard budgets against decompression bombs. No OCR: scanned PDFs return a clear error. |
| DOCX | `convert/docx` | Headings, bold/italic/strikethrough, sub/superscript, nested lists, tables (incl. gridSpan/vMerge), hyperlinks, image placeholders, tracked changes. Equations degrade to plain text. |
| XLSX | `convert/xlsx` | Every sheet as `## SheetName` + a Markdown table. |
| PPTX | `convert/pptx` | Slides in order with `<!-- Slide number: N -->` markers, position-based reading order, tables, chart data tables, image alt text, speaker notes. |
| HTML | `convert/html` | DOM sanitization (scripts/styles dropped, `javascript:` links unwrapped, data URIs truncated) + GFM tables. |
| CSV | `convert/csv` | Charset-aware (incl. Shift-JIS/cp932), delimiter sniffing (`, ; \t \|`). |
| Plain text | built into core | Charset-detected passthrough (UTF-8/16, legacy encodings). |

## Install the CLI

```sh
go install github.com/giraffesyo/downmark/cmd/downmark@latest
```

```
usage: downmark [flags] [file]      # stdin if file omitted or "-"; Markdown → stdout
  -o file           write output to file
  -x .ext           extension hint (leading dot optional)
  -m type           MIME type hint
  -c charset        charset hint, e.g. shift_jis
  -keep-data-uris   keep full data: URIs
  -version          print version
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` conversion failed, `2` usage error.

## Library

Pay for what you import: the core engine pulls only lightweight detection
dependencies; each format package brings its own.

```go
import (
    "github.com/giraffesyo/downmark"
    "github.com/giraffesyo/downmark/convert/pdf"
)

e := downmark.New() // core engine (plain-text passthrough builtin)
pdf.Register(e)     // link only the PDF stack

res, err := e.ConvertFile(ctx, "report.pdf")
// res.Markdown, res.Title
```

Everything wired up (what the CLI uses):

```go
import "github.com/giraffesyo/downmark/all"

res, err := all.ConvertFile(ctx, "report.docx")
// or: e := all.New(all.Options{KeepDataURIs: true})
```

Indicative binary sizes (`-trimpath -ldflags "-s -w"`, darwin/arm64): a
PDF-only consumer ≈ 4.9 MB, CSV-only ≈ 4.5 MB, everything ≈ 7.5 MB.

## MarkItDown comparison

Downmark and [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) solve the
same end-to-end problem, so the comparison uses their CLI interfaces against
the same fixtures. Each value is the median of five complete conversions,
including process startup and Markdown written to stdout. Both tools returned
successfully for every fixture.

Measured 2026-07-13 at commit `c0835be`, with Go `1.26.4`, MarkItDown
`0.1.6`, Python `3.14.2`, and macOS `26.5.1` on an Apple M5 Pro
(`darwin/arm64`). Re-run on your target environment before making a
performance decision.

| Fixture | Downmark | MarkItDown |
|---|---:|---:|
| PDF | 6.8 ms | 388.0 ms |
| PDF (Form XObject + ToUnicode) | 6.4 ms | 320.8 ms |
| DOCX | 6.6 ms | 331.6 ms |
| XLSX | 6.2 ms | 324.0 ms |
| PPTX | 6.4 ms | 324.5 ms |
| HTML | 6.2 ms | 358.2 ms |
| Shift-JIS CSV | 5.2 ms | 321.3 ms |

Markdown is allowed to differ when both renderings are valid. The comparison
runner records each output's byte count and digest so changes are visible;
Downmark's golden tests define its output contract. Run the benchmark and
inspect its raw output with the commands in
[benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md).

Custom converters implement `downmark.Converter` (use
`StreamInfo.Matches` in `Accepts`) and register with
`e.Register(conv, downmark.PrioritySpecific)`; converters registered later
at the same priority are tried first, so yours shadow the builtins.

Errors: `errors.Is(err, downmark.ErrUnsupportedFormat)` when nothing
matched; `*downmark.ConversionError` (with per-converter attempts) when
converters matched but failed.

## PDF extraction

PDF text extraction lives in its own module,
[github.com/giraffesyo/pdf](https://github.com/giraffesyo/pdf), usable
without the converter framework — positioned glyphs, line/word
reconstruction, and hardening against malformed and hostile files.

## Limitations

- **No OCR.** Scanned/image-only PDFs and text-converted-to-outlines fail
  with "no extractable text" rather than silently emitting nothing.
- PDF: complex multi-column layouts may interleave; fonts lacking both a
  ToUnicode map and a standard encoding are dropped rather than emitted as
  garbage; borderless table-layout reconstruction is not yet implemented.
- DOCX: headers/footers, footnotes, comments, and text boxes are skipped;
  equations render as plain text; nested tables flatten to text.
- Encrypted Office files and PDFs are not decrypted.
- Non-seekable inputs (stdin, network streams) are buffered fully in memory.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...                       # unit + vector + golden tests
go test -run TestGolden -update .   # refresh golden files
golangci-lint run ./...             # lint (config in .golangci.yml)
```

Test fixtures under `testdata/` partly come from
[microsoft/markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) (MIT); see
`testdata/NOTICE.md`.
